vNESp5 is a library integrating the "processing" programming language (http://processing.org) with a Nintendo NES emulator. 
The library is intended to help artists to create experimental games by using old games with new interfaces.

More information and documentation in:
http://mcanet.info/vNESp5/

The library is based on vNes emulator release first version in June 2006 by Jamie Sanders (http://www.thatsanderskid.com/programming/vnes/)

Note: Any rom file is included in the code examples. Before use an example add the file of the NES rom game in the data folder.

For Linux users:
We had detect problems in some linux distributions like ubuntu 10.10, but there is a way to make it work.

1. You have to add in the example setup: myEmulador.setSoundBufferFixTimeToSleep(8);
2. Rename the java directory in the processing directory to something else to make processing look for the  java jdk installed on Ubuntu, in my case openjdk6.

NOTE: If you do want to use the java that processing comes with, do not rename the java directory in processing,  install openjdk6 and do the following:

cp /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/lib/i386/libpulse-java.so PROCESSING_DIR/java/lib/i386
cp /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/lib/ext/pulse-java.jar      PROCESSING_DIR/java/lib/ext
