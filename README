More information and documentation in:

Library is base in vNes emulator release first version in June 2006 by Jamie Sanders (http://www.thatsanderskid.com/programming/vnes/)

Note: Any rom file is included in the code examples. Before use an example add the file of the NES rom game in the data folder.

For Linux users:
We had detect problems in some linux distributions like ubuntu 10.10, but there is a way to make it work.

1. You have to add in the example setup: myEmulador.setSoundBufferFixTimeToSleep(8);
2. Rename the java directory in the processing directory to something else to make processing look for the  java jdk installed on Ubuntu, in my case openjdk6.
